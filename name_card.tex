\subsection{Name card contract} \label{sec:name_card_contract}
A \abbrev{NNC}{Network Name Card} is a record which are composed of two archives \abbrev{NCL}{Name Card Label} and \abbrev{NCR}{Name Card Record} both of the archives are stored in the DART.

The NCL label card sets the NNC name and NCR record stores the data related to the name-card (see \cref{tab:ncr}). The two archives are always updated in pairs in the network.

The hash-pointer of an NCL is calculated for the name-parameter and not for the archives in itself. The NCL can and must only contain the parameter as shown in the  \cref{tab:ncl}.

When an NNC is updated the NCR is updated, the $\$previous$ hash-pointer is set to the previous NCR and the $\$index$ is increased by one. The $\$record$ parameter in NCL is set to the hash-pointer of NCR and $\$sign$ is set to the signature of $\$record$.

The $\$index$ of the first NCR is set to $0$, and the $\$previous$ parameter is to hash value of $\$pubkey$ of the NCL archive.

The $\$lang$ sets the type of restricted letters and symbols which is allowed to be used in the NNC name.
