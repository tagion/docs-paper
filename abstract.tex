\begin{abstract}
This paper describes an alternative implementation of a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) network compared to a classical network such as Bitcoin. Most other DLT networks use a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism to secure the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) of the data storage. In the Tagion network, the BFT is based on the Hashgraph algorithm and data storage on a new type of Distributed Hash Table (DHT) which makes it efficient to maintain a distributed database and guarantee BFT. The Hashgraph algorithm is deterministic and not probabilistic, allowing ordering of transactions. The order of transactions combined with the Lightning Network and the Tagion matching and settlement protocol constitutes a Decentralised Exchange (DEX) protocol on the Tagion network. 

To reduce the probability of the network being taken over by an evil group of actors, a new governance model is proposed, which does not rely on a central control or a group of master-nodes.
