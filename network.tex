\section{Network}\label{sec:network}
The following steps are executed in the network for a standard transaction:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item 
     The transaction object is sent to one of the active nodes (an inactive node should relay the transaction object to an active node).
 \item 
    When a node receives a transaction object, its format and the signatures of all the inputs are checked.
 \item 
    If the transaction object is valid, it is added to the payload of an event.
 \item 
    The event is gossiped to the network.
 \item 
    The payload is put into an epoch list in order.
 \item 
    The epoch list is processed in the epoch order.
 \item 
    All inputs to the transaction are collected from the DART database.
 \item 
    The transaction script is executed when all inputs are read from the DART.
 \item 
    The output of the transaction scripts is gossiped to the network.
 \item 
    When the network reaches consensus on all outputs of the transactions, the DART is updated. 
 \item 
    The new Merkle root (Bull’s eye) of the DART is calculated, and the Bull’s eye is gossiped to the network. 
 \item 
    When the majority of the nodes reach consensus on the Bull’s eye, it is added to the DART blockchain. The transaction is now approved.
\end{enumerate}
