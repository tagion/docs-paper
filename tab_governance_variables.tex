  \hline
  Variable name & Definition and scoring rule \\
  \hline
  Birthdate & The date a prospect node becomes a node. \\
  \hline
  Gene & A gene is unique for each node. \\
  \hline
  Gene score (Gene-diversification points) & Each time a node mates with another node, a score is calculated for them both based on how diverse their genes are compared to each other. They mate each time verification of a prospect node takes place, when an active node makes an epoch, see \cref{sec:hashgraph_cm}, and when two nodes choose to mate and validate each other. \\
  \hline
  Node age & A measure of a node's total available time for the network. Time as both a node and an active node. It increases both as a node and active node when available for the network. \\
  \hline
  Active time & Time as an active node. It increases when a node is active.\\
  \hline
  Prospect score & The Prospect score variable is a measure of how much the prospect node has been available to the network. It increases when the prospect node is available and decreases when not. \\
  \hline
  Contribution loyalty & A measure of how much the node has been active and stayed available. Non-availability of a node decreases contribution loyalty; being an active node increases loyalty. \\
