\section{Consensus Probability}

\paragraph{Epoch consensus}
In the following the probability for the Hashgraph-algorithm to reach an Epoch consensus within $H$ events consecutive is estimated in a simple model as follows.\\

The network participants are given by the flowing parameters.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[$H$] is the number of event for a node to reach Epoch-consensus.
	\item[$M$] is the total number of nodes which are available for the network (This includes active and passive nodes, not prospect nodes). 
	\item[$n$] is the number of nodes which has not yet been seen by the current node. 
\end{itemize}

The probability for a node to gossip to another node which has not yet been seen:
\begin{equation}
P_{n} = \frac{M-n}{M}
\end{equation}

The number $H$ is define as more than $2/3$ of the number $M$.

\begin{equation}
H = floor \left( \frac{2}{3} M \right)
\end{equation}

The probability for gossip $h$ different nodes in $h$ consecutive events can calculated as:
\begin{equation}
P_{h,0} = \prod _{n=1}^{h} P_n
\end{equation}


The probability for gossip $h$ different nodes in $h+1$ consecutive events can calculated as:
\begin{equation}
P_{h,i} = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \prod _{n=1}^{h+1} P_n
\end{equation}

A binary vector $S_{h,H}$ is defined as follow:

\begin{align}
S_{h,H} = [b_{0}, b_{1} .. b_{h-1}] ~ b_{i} \in \mathbb{B}\\
\text{where}\\
\sum S_{h,H} = H
\end{align}




\begin{equation}
P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
\end{equation}
